could he have been thinking of? It must have been a
trick of the light. Mr
. Dursley blinked and stared at

the cat. It stared back. As Mr
. Dursley drove around the corner and up the
road, he watched the cat in his
mirror
. It was now reading the sign that said Privet
Drive — no, 
looking
 at the sign; cats couldn’
t read
maps 
or
 signs. Mr
. Dursley gave himself a little shake
and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward
town he thought of nothing except a lar
ge order of
drills he was hoping to get that day
.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his
mind by something else. As he sat in the usual
morning traf
fic jam, he couldn’
t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
about. People in cloaks. Mr
. Dursley couldn’
t bear
people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups
you saw on young people! He supposed this was some
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the
steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these

weirdos standing quite close by
. They were whispering
excitedly together
. Mr
. Dursley was enraged to see
that a couple of them weren’
t young at all; why
, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an
emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it
struck Mr
. Dursley that this was probably some silly
stunt — these people were obviously collecting for
something … yes, that would be it. The traf
fic moved
on and a few minutes later
, Mr
. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr
. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in
his of
fice on the ninth floor
. If he hadn’
t, he might
have found it harder to concentrate on drills that
morning. 
He
 didn’
t see the owls swooping past in
broad daylight, though people down in the street did;
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an
owl even at nighttime. Mr
. Dursley
, however
, had a
perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
dif
ferent people. He made several important telephone

calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good
mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a
bun from the bakery
.
He’d for
gotten all about the people in cloaks until he
passed a group of them next to the baker
’
s. He eyed
them angrily as he passed. He didn’
t know why
, but
they made him uneasy
. This bunch were whispering
excitedly
, too, and he couldn’
t see a single collecting
tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a
lar
ge doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words
of what they were saying.
“The Potters, that’
s right, that’
s what I heard —”
“— yes, their son, Harry —”
Mr
. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say
something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his
www.ztcprep.com

of
fice, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him,
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing
his home number when he changed his mind. He put
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache,
thinking … no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’
t
such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry
.
Come to think of it, he wasn’
t even sure his nephew
was
 called Harry
. He’d never even seen the boy
. It
might have been Harvey
. Or Harold. There was no
point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so
upset at any mention of her sister
. He didn’
t blame
her — if 
he’d
 had a sister like that … but all the
same, those people in cloaks …

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he
left the building at five o’clock,
he was still so worried that he walked straight into
someone just outside the door
.
“Sorry
,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled
www.ztcprep.com

and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr
.
Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet
cloak. He didn’
t seem at all upset at being almost
knocked to the ground. On the contrary
, his face split
into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that
made passersby stare, “Don’
t be sorry
, my dear sir
,
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for Y
ou-
Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like
yourself should be celebrating, this happy
, happy
day!”
And the old man hugged Mr
. Dursley around the
middle and walked of
f.
Mr
. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been
hugged by a complete stranger
. He also thought he
had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was
rattled. He hurried to his car and set of
f for home,
hoping he was imagining things, which he had never
hoped before, because he didn’
t approve of
imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four
, the

first thing he saw — and it didn’
t improve his mood —
was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was
now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr
. Dursley loudly
.
The cat didn’
t move. It just gave him a stern look.
W
as this normal cat behavior? Mr
. Dursley wondered.
T
rying to pull himself together
, he let himself into the

house. He was still determined not to mention
anything to his wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day
. She told
him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door
’
s problems
with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new
word (“W
on’
t!”). Mr
. Dursley tried to act normally
.
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the
living room in time to catch the last report on the
evening news:
“And finally
, bird-watchers everywhere have reported
www.ztcprep.com

that the nation’
s owls have been behaving very
unusually today
. Although owls normally hunt at
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have
been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in
every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their
sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a
grin. “Most mysterious. And now
, over to Jim
McGuf
fin with the weather
. Going to be any more
showers of owls tonight, Jim?”
“W
ell, T
ed,” said the weatherman, “I don’
t know about
that, but it’
s not only the owls that have been acting
oddly today
. V
iewers as far apart as Kent, Y
orkshire,
and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that
instead of the rain I promised yesterday
, they’ve had a
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have
been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’
s not until
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night
tonight.”
Mr
. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair

all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious
people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper
, a
whisper about the Potters …

Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two
cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say
something to her
. He cleared his throat nervously
. “Er
— Petunia, dear — you haven’
t heard from your sister
lately
, have you?”
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and
angry
. After all, they normally pretended she didn’
t
have a sister
.
“No,” she said sharply
. “Why?”
“Funny stuf
f on the news,” Mr
. Dursley mumbled.
“Owls … shooting stars … and there were a lot of
funny-looking people in town today …”
“
So
?” snapped Mrs. Dursley
.
“W
ell, I just thought … maybe … it was something to
do with … you know … 
her
 crowd.”

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr
.
Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d
heard the name “Potter
.” He decided he didn’
t dare.
Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son —
he’d be about Dudley’
s age now
, wouldn’
t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stif
fly
.
“What’
s his name again? Howard, isn’
t it?”
“Harry
. Nasty
, common name, if you ask me.”
“Oh, yes,” said Mr
. Dursley
, his heart sinking
horribly
. “Y
es, I quite agree.”
He didn’
t say another word on the subject as they
went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the
bathroom, Mr
. Dursley crept to the bedroom window

and peered down into the front garden. The cat was
still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though
it were waiting for something.

anything to do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out

that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’
t
think he could bear it.
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep
quickly but Mr
. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over
in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell
asleep was that even if the Potters 
wer
e
 involved,
there was no reason for them to come near him and
Mrs. Dursley
. The Potters knew very well what he and
Petunia thought about them and their kind. … He
couldn’
t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up
in anything that might be going on — he yawned and
turned over — it couldn’
t af
fect 
them. …
How very wrong he was.
Mr
. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy
sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no
sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue,
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet
Drive. It didn’
t so much as quiver when a car door
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight
